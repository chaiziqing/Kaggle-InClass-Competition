# Kaggle-InClass-Competition

This is programming assignment 3 from the course T81-855: Applications of Deep Learning at Washington University in St. Louis. All students must create a Kaggle account and submit a solution. Once you have submitted your solution entry log into Schoology (at WUSTL) and submit a single file telling me your Kaggle name on the leaderboard (you do not need to register to Kaggle with your real name). This competition will be visible to the public, so there may be non-student submissions as well as student.
